Title 2: Sequencing of individual barcoded cDNAs using Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies reveals platform-specific error patterns. Title 3: ScisorWiz: visualizing differential isoform expression in single-cell long-read data. Title 4: Accurate isoform discovery with IsoQuant using long reads.,"Abstract 1: Splicing varies across brain regions, but the single-cell resolution of regional variation is unclear. We present a single-cell investigation of differential isoform expression (DIE) between brain regions using single-cell long-read sequencing in mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in 45 cell types at postnatal day 7 ( www.isoformAtlas.com ). Isoform tests for DIE show better performance than exon tests. We detect hundreds of DIE events traceable to cell types, often corresponding to functionally distinct protein isoforms. Mostly, one cell type is responsible for brain-region specific DIE. However, for fewer genes, multiple cell types influence DIE. Thus, regional identity can, although rarely, override cell-type specificity. Cell types indigenous to one anatomic structure display distinctive DIE, e.g. the choroid plexus epithelium manifests distinct transcription-start-site usage. Spatial transcriptomics and long-read sequencing yield a spatially resolved splicing map. Our methods quantify isoform expression with cell-type and spatial resolution and it contributes to further our understanding of how the brain integrates molecular and cellular complexity. Abstract 2: Long-read transcriptomics require understanding error sources inherent to technologies. Current approaches cannot compare methods for an individual RNA molecule. Here, we present a novel platform-comparison method that combines barcoding strategies and long-read sequencing to sequence cDNA copies representing an individual RNA molecule on both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). We compare these long-read pairs in terms of sequence content and isoform patterns. Although individual read pairs show high similarity, we find differences in (1) aligned length, (2) transcription start site (TSS), (3) polyadenylation site (poly(A)-site) assignment, and (4) exon-intron structures. Overall, 25% of read pairs disagree on either TSS, poly(A)-site, or splice site. Intron-chain disagreement typically arises from alignment errors of microexons and complicated splice sites. Our single-molecule technology comparison reveals that inconsistencies are often caused by sequencing error-induced inaccurate ONT alignments, especially to downstream GUNNGU donor motifs. However, annotation-disagreeing upstream shifts in NAGNAG acceptors in ONT are often confirmed by PacBio and are thus likely real. In both barcoded and nonbarcoded ONT reads, we find that intron number and proximity of GU/AGs better predict inconsistencies with the annotation than read quality alone. We summarize these findings in an annotation-based algorithm for spliced alignment correction that improves subsequent transcript construction with ONT reads. Abstract 3: Summary: RNA isoforms contribute to the diverse functionality of the proteins they encode within the cell. Visualizing how isoform expression differs across cell types and brain regions can inform our understanding of disease and gain or loss of functionality caused by alternative splicing with potential negative impacts. However, the extent to which this occurs in specific cell types and brain regions is largely unknown. This is the kind of information that ScisorWiz plots can provide in an informative and easily communicable manner. ScisorWiz affords its user the opportunity to visualize specific genes across any number of cell types, and provides various sorting options for the user to gain different ways to understand their data. ScisorWiz provides a clear picture of differential isoform expression through various clustering methods and highlights features such as alternative exons and single-nucleotide variants. Tools like ScisorWiz are key for interpreting single-cell isoform sequencing data. This tool applies to any single-cell long-read RNA sequencing data in any cell type, tissue or species.

Abstract 4: Annotating newly sequenced genomes and determining alternative isoforms from long-read RNA data are complex and incompletely solved problems. Here we present IsoQuant-a computational tool using intron graphs that accurately reconstructs transcripts both with and without reference genome annotation. For novel transcript discovery, IsoQuant reduces the false-positive rate fivefold and 2.5-fold for Oxford Nanopore reference-based or reference-free mode, respectively. IsoQuant also improves performance for Pacific Biosciences data. ",Keywords 1:  Keywords 2:  Keywords 3:  Keywords 4:,False,Visium,3024,31053

Ureteric bud branching forms the arborized collecting duct system of the kidney, while ureteric tips promote nephron formation from dedicated progenitor cells. While nephron progenitor cells are relatively well characterized, the origin of ureteric bud progenitors has received little attention so far. It is well established that the ureteric bud is induced from the nephric duct, an epithelial duct derived from the intermediate mesoderm of the embryo. However, the cell state transitions underlying the progression from intermediate mesoderm to nephric duct and ureteric bud remain unknown. Here we show that nephric duct morphogenesis results from the coordinated organization of four major progenitor cell populations. Using single cell RNA-seq and Cluster RNA-seq, we show that these progenitors emerge in time and space according to a stereotypical pattern. We identify the transcription factors Tfap2a/b and Gata3 as critical coordinators of this progenitor cell progression. This study provides a better understanding of the cellular origin of the renal collecting duct system and associated urinary tract developmental diseases, which may inform guided differentiation of functional kidney tissue.",,False,Visium,178,53574

Here, we show the genetic inhibition of tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) sensory nerve innervation of the developing cranium results in premature calvarial suture closure, associated with a decrease in suture MPC proliferation and increased mineralization. In vitro, axons from peripheral afferent neurons derived from dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) of wild-type mice induce MPC proliferation in a spatially restricted manner via a soluble factor when cocultured in microfluidic chambers. Comparative spatial transcriptomic analysis of the cranial sutures in vivo confirmed a positive association between sensory axons and proliferative MPCs. SpatialTime analysis across the developing suture revealed regional-specific alterations in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF-β signaling pathway transcripts in response to TrkA inhibition.

Central to this regenerative process is the blastema, a heterogeneous population of lineage-restricted, dedifferentiated cells that ultimately orchestrates regeneration of the amputated bone and surrounding soft tissue. To investigate skeletal regeneration, we made use of spatial transcriptomics to characterize the transcriptional profile specifically within the blastema. Using this technique, we generated a gene signature with high specificity for the blastema in both our spatial data, as well as other previously published single-cell RNA-sequencing transcriptomic studies. To elucidate potential mechanisms distinguishing regenerative from non-regenerative healing, we applied spatial transcriptomics to an aging model. Consistent with other forms of repair, our digit amputation mouse model showed a significant impairment in regeneration in aged mice. Contrasting young and aged mice, spatial analysis revealed a metabolic shift in aged blastema associated with an increased bioenergetic requirement. This enhanced metabolic turnover was associated with increased hypoxia and angiogenic signaling, leading to excessive vascularization and altered regenerated bone architecture in aged mice. Administration of the metabolite oxaloacetate decreased the oxygen consumption rate of the aged blastema and increased WNT signaling, leading to enhanced in vivo bone regeneration. Thus, targeting cell metabolism may be a promising strategy to mitigate aging-induced declines in tissue regeneration.",aging; bone regeneration; cell biology; cell metabolism; digit regeneration; mouse; oxaloacetate; spatial transcriptomics.,False,Visium,1007,31053

GSE182208_GSM5531131,human,skin,35192691,Endothelial Phospholipase Cγ2 Improves Outcomes of Diabetic Ischemic Limb Rescue Following VEGF Therapy,"Therapeutic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) replenishment has met with limited success for the management of critical limb-threatening ischemia. To improve outcomes of VEGF therapy, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology to study the endothelial cells of the human diabetic skin. Single-cell suspensions were generated from the human skin followed by cDNA preparation using the Chromium Next GEM Single-cell 3' Kit v3.1. Using appropriate quality control measures, 36,487 cells were chosen for downstream analysis. scRNA-seq studies identified that although VEGF signaling was not significantly altered in diabetic versus nondiabetic skin, phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) was downregulated. The significance of PLCγ2 in VEGF-mediated increase in endothelial cell metabolism and function was assessed in cultured human microvascular endothelial cells. In these cells, VEGF enhanced mitochondrial function, as indicated by elevation in oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate. The VEGF-dependent increase in cell metabolism was blunted in response to PLCγ2 inhibition. Follow-up rescue studies therefore focused on understanding the significance of VEGF therapy in presence or absence of endothelial PLCγ2 in type 1 (streptozotocin-injected) and type 2 (db/db) diabetic ischemic tissue. Nonviral topical tissue nanotransfection technology (TNT) delivery of CDH5 promoter-driven PLCγ2 open reading frame promoted the rescue of hindlimb ischemia in diabetic mice. Improvement of blood flow was also associated with higher abundance of VWF+/CD31+ and VWF+/SMA+ immunohistochemical staining. TNT-based gene delivery was not associated with tissue edema, a commonly noted complication associated with proangiogenic gene therapies. Taken together, our study demonstrates that TNT-mediated delivery of endothelial PLCγ2, as part of combination gene therapy, is effective in diabetic ischemic limb rescue.",,False,Visium,2603,33538

New spatial transcriptomic sequencing platforms make it possible to measure the topography of gene expression at genome depth.

Methods: We optimized and validated a female bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury model. Using the 10× Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression solution, we generated spatial maps of gene expression across the injury and repair time course, and applied two open-source computational tools, Giotto and SPOTlight, to increase resolution and measure cell-cell interaction dynamics.

Results: An ischemia time of 34 minutes in a female murine model resulted in comparable injury to 22 minutes for males. We report a total of 16,856 unique genes mapped across our injury and repair time course. Giotto, a computational toolbox for spatial data analysis, enabled increased resolution mapping of genes and cell types. Using a seeded nonnegative matrix regression (SPOTlight) to deconvolute the dynamic landscape of cell-cell interactions, we found that injured proximal tubule cells were characterized by increasing macrophage and lymphocyte interactions even 6 weeks after injury, potentially reflecting the AKI to CKD transition.

Conclusions: In this transcriptomic atlas, we defined region-specific and injury-induced loss of differentiation markers and their re-expression during repair, as well as region-specific injury and repair transcriptional responses.

GSE184510_GSM5591755,human,brain,37081484,Size matters: the impact of nucleus size on results from spatial transcriptomics,"Background: Visium Spatial Gene Expression (ST) is a method combining histological spatial information with transcriptomics profiles directly from tissue sections. The use of spatial information has made it possible to discover new modes of gene expression regulations. However, in the ST experiment, the nucleus size of cells may exceed the thickness of a tissue slice. This may, in turn, negatively affect comprehensive capturing the transcriptomics profile in a single slice, especially for tissues having large differences in the size of nuclei.

Methods: Here, we defined the effect of Consecutive Slices Data Integration (CSDI) on unveiling accurate spot clustering and deconvolution of spatial transcriptomic spots in human postmortem brains. By considering the histological information as reference, we assessed the improvement of unsupervised clustering and single nuclei RNA-seq and ST data integration before and after CSDI.

Results: Apart from the escalated number of defined clusters representing neuronal layers, the pattern of clusters in consecutive sections was concordant only after CSDI. Besides, the assigned cell labels to spots matches the histological pattern of tissue sections after CSDI.

To elucidate the mechanism underlying the oncogene-induced gastric tumor progression, we have developed an organoid-based model of gastric cancer from GAstric Neoplasia (GAN) mice, which express Wnt1 and the enzymes COX2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 in the stomach. Both p53 knockout (GAN-p53KO) organoids and KRASG12V -expressing GAN-p53KO (GAN-KP) organoids were generated by genetic manipulation of GAN mouse-derived tumor (GAN wild-type [WT]) organoids. In contrast with GAN-WT and GAN-p53KO organoids, which manifested Wnt addiction, GAN-KP organoids showed a Wnt-independent phenotype and the ability to proliferate without formation of a Wnt-regulated three-dimensional epithelial architecture. After transplantation in syngeneic mouse stomach, GAN-p53KO cells formed only small tumors, whereas GAN-KP cells gave rise to invasive tumors associated with the development of hypoxia as well as to liver metastasis. Spatial transcriptomics analysis suggested that hypoxia signaling contributes to the metastatic progression of GAN-KP tumors. In particular, such analysis identified a cluster of stromal cells located at the tumor invasive front that expressed genes related to hypoxia signaling, angiogenesis, and cell migration. These cells were also positive for phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), suggesting that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling promotes development of both tumor and microenvironment. The MEK (MAPK kinase) inhibitor trametinib suppressed the development of GAN-KP gastric tumors, formation of a hypoxic microenvironment, tumor angiogenesis, and liver metastasis. Our findings therefore establish a rationale for application of trametinib to suppress metastatic progression of KRAS-mutated gastric cancer.",MEK; epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); gastric cancer; hypoxia; mouse model.,True,Visium,2429,31054
GSE186818_GSM5661565,fish,brain,36306789,Prostaglandin E2 synchronizes lunar-regulated beach spawning in grass puffers,"Many organisms living along the coastlines synchronize their reproduction with the lunar cycle. At the time of spring tide, thousands of grass puffers (Takifugu alboplumbeus) aggregate and vigorously tremble their bodies at the water's edge to spawn. To understand the mechanisms underlying this spectacular semilunar beach spawning, we collected the hypothalamus and pituitary from male grass puffers every week for 2 months. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis identified 125 semilunar genes, including genes crucial for reproduction (e.g., gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 [gnrh1], luteinizing hormone β subunit [lhb]) and receptors for pheromone prostaglandin E (PGE). PGE2 is secreted into the seawater during the spawning, and its administration activates olfactory sensory neurons and triggers trembling behavior of surrounding individuals. These results suggest that PGE2 synchronizes lunar-regulated beach-spawning behavior in grass puffers. To further explore the mechanism that regulates the lunar-synchronized transcription of semilunar genes, we searched for semilunar transcription factors. Spatial transcriptomics and multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization showed co-localization of the semilunar transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (cebpd) and gnrh1, and cebpd induced the promoter activity of gnrh1. Taken together, our study demonstrates semilunar genes that mediate lunar-synchronized beach-spawning behavior.

Title 2: The C1q-ApoE complex: A new hallmark pathology of viral hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.,"Abstract 1: The liver is the largest solid organ in the body, yet it remains incompletely characterized. Here we present a spatial proteogenomic atlas of the healthy and obese human and murine liver combining single-cell CITE-seq, single-nuclei sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and spatial proteomics. By integrating these multi-omic datasets, we provide validated strategies to reliably discriminate and localize all hepatic cells, including a population of lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) at the bile ducts. We then align this atlas across seven species, revealing the conserved program of bona fide Kupffer cells and LAMs. We also uncover the respective spatially resolved cellular niches of these macrophages and the microenvironmental circuits driving their unique transcriptomic identities. We demonstrate that LAMs are induced by local lipid exposure, leading to their induction in steatotic regions of the murine and human liver, while Kupffer cell development crucially depends on their cross-talk with hepatic stellate cells via the evolutionarily conserved ALK1-BMP9/10 axis. Abstract 2: We recently identified a high-affinity C1q-ApoE complex in human artery atherosclerotic intima lesions and in human amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's Disease brains defining a common pathogenetic pathway of two diverse diseases, i.e. atherosclerosis and dementia. C1q is the initiating and controlling protein of the classical complement cascade (CCC), which occupies a key role in multiple acute and chronic inflammatory tissue responses. C1q is largely produced by myeloid cells including Kupffer cells (KCs) and subsequently secreted into the circulation as an inactive preprotein. Its binding partner, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), is produced by KCs and hepatocytes and it is also secreted into the circulation, where it regulates essential steps of lipid transport. In addition to its major source, ApoE can be produced by non-liver cells including immune cells and multiple other cells depending on local tissue contexts. To initiate the CCC cascade, C1q must be activated by molecules as varied as oxidized lipids, amyloid fibrils, and immune complexes. However, ApoE is mute towards inactive C1q but binds at high-affinity to its activated form. Specifically, our studies revealed that ApoE is a CCC-specific checkpoint inhibitor via the formation of the C1q-ApoE complex. We proposed that it may arise in multiple if not all CCC-associated diseases and that its presence indicates ongoing CCC activity. Here, we turned to the liver to examine C1q-ApoE complexes in human B- and C-viral hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In addition, we used multidrug-resistance-2 gene-knockout (Mdr2-KO) mice as a model for inflammatory liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis. In normal murine and human livers, KCs were the major C1q-producing cell type while hepatocytes were the primary ApoE-forming cell type though the C1q-ApoE complex was rare or nonexistent. However, significant numbers of C1q-ApoE complexes formed in both Mdr2-KO, human viral hepatitis, and NAFLD around portal triads where immune cells had infiltrated the liver. Additionally, high numbers of C1q-ApoE complexes emerged in human livers in areas of extracellular lipid droplets across the entire liver parenchyma in NAFLD-affected patients.

In normal murine and human livers, KCs were the major C1q-producing cell type while hepatocytes were the primary ApoE-forming cell type though the C1q-ApoE complex was rare or nonexistent. However, significant numbers of C1q-ApoE complexes formed in both Mdr2-KO, human viral hepatitis, and NAFLD around portal triads where immune cells had infiltrated the liver. Additionally, high numbers of C1q-ApoE complexes emerged in human livers in areas of extracellular lipid droplets across the entire liver parenchyma in NAFLD-affected patients.

Here we present a spatial proteogenomic atlas of the healthy and obese human and murine liver combining single-cell CITE-seq, single-nuclei sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and spatial proteomics. By integrating these multi-omic datasets, we provide validated strategies to reliably discriminate and localize all hepatic cells, including a population of lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) at the bile ducts. We then align this atlas across seven species, revealing the conserved program of bona fide Kupffer cells and LAMs. We also uncover the respective spatially resolved cellular niches of these macrophages and the microenvironmental circuits driving their unique transcriptomic identities. We demonstrate that LAMs are induced by local lipid exposure, leading to their induction in steatotic regions of the murine and human liver, while Kupffer cell development crucially depends on their cross-talk with hepatic stellate cells via the evolutionarily conserved ALK1-BMP9/10 axis. Abstract 2: We recently identified a high-affinity C1q-ApoE complex in human artery atherosclerotic intima lesions and in human amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's Disease brains defining a common pathogenetic pathway of two diverse diseases, i.e. atherosclerosis and dementia. C1q is the initiating and controlling protein of the classical complement cascade (CCC), which occupies a key role in multiple acute and chronic inflammatory tissue responses. C1q is largely produced by myeloid cells including Kupffer cells (KCs) and subsequently secreted into the circulation as an inactive preprotein. Its binding partner, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), is produced by KCs and hepatocytes and it is also secreted into the circulation, where it regulates essential steps of lipid transport. In addition to its major source, ApoE can be produced by non-liver cells including immune cells and multiple other cells depending on local tissue contexts. To initiate the CCC cascade, C1q must be activated by molecules as varied as oxidized lipids, amyloid fibrils, and immune complexes. However, ApoE is mute towards inactive C1q but binds at high-affinity to its activated form. Specifically, our studies revealed that ApoE is a CCC-specific checkpoint inhibitor via the formation of the C1q-ApoE complex. We proposed that it may arise in multiple if not all CCC-associated diseases and that its presence indicates ongoing CCC activity.

Abstract 2: We recently identified a high-affinity C1q-ApoE complex in human artery atherosclerotic intima lesions and in human amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's Disease brains defining a common pathogenetic pathway of two diverse diseases, i.e. atherosclerosis and dementia. C1q is the initiating and controlling protein of the classical complement cascade (CCC), which occupies a key role in multiple acute and chronic inflammatory tissue responses. C1q is largely produced by myeloid cells including Kupffer cells (KCs) and subsequently secreted into the circulation as an inactive preprotein. Its binding partner, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), is produced by KCs and hepatocytes and it is also secreted into the circulation, where it regulates essential steps of lipid transport. In addition to its major source, ApoE can be produced by non-liver cells including immune cells and multiple other cells depending on local tissue contexts. To initiate the CCC cascade, C1q must be activated by molecules as varied as oxidized lipids, amyloid fibrils, and immune complexes. However, ApoE is mute towards inactive C1q but binds at high-affinity to its activated form. Specifically, our studies revealed that ApoE is a CCC-specific checkpoint inhibitor via the formation of the C1q-ApoE complex. We proposed that it may arise in multiple if not all CCC-associated diseases and that its presence indicates ongoing CCC activity. Here, we turned to the liver to examine C1q-ApoE complexes in human B- and C-viral hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In addition, we used multidrug-resistance-2 gene-knockout (Mdr2-KO) mice as a model for inflammatory liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis. In normal murine and human livers, KCs were the major C1q-producing cell type while hepatocytes were the primary ApoE-forming cell type though the C1q-ApoE complex was rare or nonexistent. However, significant numbers of C1q-ApoE complexes formed in both Mdr2-KO, human viral hepatitis, and NAFLD around portal triads where immune cells had infiltrated the liver. Additionally, high numbers of C1q-ApoE complexes emerged in human livers in areas of extracellular lipid droplets across the entire liver parenchyma in NAFLD-affected patients. Thus, the C1q-ApoE complex is a new pathological hallmark of viral hepatitis B and C and NAFLD.",Keywords 1: CITE-seq; Kupffer cell; NAFLD; across species; atlas; lipid-associated macrophage; liver; multi-omic; proteogenomic; spatial transcriptomics.

Methods: Popliteal lymph nodes (PLNs) from wild-type (n=10) and TNF-Tg male mice with """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Early"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (5 to 6-months of age; n=6) and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Advanced"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (>8-months of age; n=12) arthritis were harvested and processed for spatial transcriptomics.

Discussion: Collectively, these data support a model of flare in chronic TNF-induced arthritis in which loss of lymphatic flow through affected joint-draining lymph nodes facilitates the interaction between effluxing macrophages and T-cells via ALCAM-CD6 co-stimulation, initiating IgG2b class-switching and plasma cell differentiation of the expanded Bin population.

GSE195598_GSM5841553,mouse,lymph node,37691918,Multi-omics analysis identifies IgG2b class-switching with ALCAM-CD6 co-stimulation in joint-draining lymph nodes during advanced inflammatory-erosive arthritis,"Introduction: Defective lymphatic drainage and translocation of B-cells in inflamed (Bin) joint-draining lymph node sinuses are pathogenic phenomena in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this lymphatic dysfunction remain poorly understood. Herein, we utilized multi-omic spatial and single-cell transcriptomics to evaluate altered cellular composition (including lymphatic endothelial cells, macrophages, B-cells, and T-cells) in the joint-draining lymph node sinuses and their associated phenotypic changes and cell-cell interactions during RA development using the tumor necrosis factor transgenic (TNF-Tg) mouse model.

Methods: Popliteal lymph nodes (PLNs) from wild-type (n=10) and TNF-Tg male mice with """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Early"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (5 to 6-months of age; n=6) and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Advanced"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (>8-months of age; n=12) arthritis were harvested and processed for spatial transcriptomics. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was performed in PLNs from the TNF-Tg cohorts (n=6 PLNs pooled/cohort). PLN histopathology and ELISPOT along with ankle histology and micro-CT were evaluated. Histopathology of human lymph nodes and synovia was performed for clinical correlation.

Results: Advanced PLN sinuses exhibited an increased Ighg2b/Ighm expression ratio (Early 0.5 ± 0.1 vs Advanced 1.4 ± 0.5 counts/counts; p<0.001) that significantly correlated with reduced talus bone volumes in the afferent ankle (R2 = 0.54, p<0.001). Integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics revealed the increased IgG2b+ plasma cells localized in MARCO+ peri-follicular medullary sinuses. A concomitant decreased Fth1 expression (Early 2.5 ± 0.74 vs Advanced 1.0 ± 0.50 counts, p<0.001) within Advanced PLN sinuses was associated with accumulation of iron-laden Prussian blue positive macrophages in lymph nodes and synovium of Advanced TNF-Tg mice, and further validated in RA clinical samples. T-cells were increased 8-fold in Advanced PLNs, and bioinformatic pathway assessment identified the interaction between ALCAM+ macrophages and CD6+ T-cells as a plausible co-stimulatory mechanism to promote IgG2b class-switching.

GSE197023_GSM5907077,human,skin,37312623,Spatial transcriptomics combined with single-cell RNA-sequencing unravels the complex inflammatory cell network in atopic dermatitis,"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease with complex pathogenesis for which the cellular and molecular crosstalk in AD skin has not been fully understood.

Methods: Skin tissues examined for spatial gene expression were derived from the upper arm of 6 healthy control (HC) donors and 7 AD patients (lesion and nonlesion). We performed spatial transcriptomics sequencing to characterize the cellular infiltrate in lesional skin. For single-cell analysis, we analyzed the single-cell data from suction blister material from AD lesions and HC skin at the antecubital fossa skin (4 ADs and 5 HCs) and full-thickness skin biopsies (4 ADs and 2 HCs). The multiple proximity extension assays were performed in the serum samples from 36 AD patients and 28 HCs.

Results: The single-cell analysis identified unique clusters of fibroblasts, dendritic cells, and macrophages in the lesional AD skin. Spatial transcriptomics analysis showed the upregulation of COL6A5, COL4A1, TNC, and CCL19 in COL18A1-expressing fibroblasts in the leukocyte-infiltrated areas in AD skin. CCR7-expressing dendritic cells (DCs) showed a similar distribution in the lesions. Additionally, M2 macrophages expressed CCL13 and CCL18 in this area. Ligand-receptor interaction analysis of the spatial transcriptome identified neighboring infiltration and interaction between activated COL18A1-expressing fibroblasts, CCL13- and CCL18-expressing M2 macrophages, CCR7- and LAMP3-expressing DCs, and T cells. As observed in skin lesions, serum levels of TNC and CCL18 were significantly elevated in AD, and correlated with clinical disease severity.

Spatial transcriptomics analysis showed the upregulation of COL6A5, COL4A1, TNC, and CCL19 in COL18A1-expressing fibroblasts in the leukocyte-infiltrated areas in AD skin. CCR7-expressing dendritic cells (DCs) showed a similar distribution in the lesions. Additionally, M2 macrophages expressed CCL13 and CCL18 in this area. Ligand-receptor interaction analysis of the spatial transcriptome identified neighboring infiltration and interaction between activated COL18A1-expressing fibroblasts, CCL13- and CCL18-expressing M2 macrophages, CCR7- and LAMP3-expressing DCs, and T cells. As observed in skin lesions, serum levels of TNC and CCL18 were significantly elevated in AD, and correlated with clinical disease severity.

Methods: To assess the consequences of inducible Inpp5d knockdown in microglia of APPKM670/671NL /PSEN1Δexon9 (PSAPP) mice, we injected 3-month-old Inpp5dfl/fl /Cx3cr1CreER/+ and PSAPP/Inpp5dfl/fl /Cx3cr1CreER/+ mice with either tamoxifen (TAM) or corn oil (CO) to induce recombination.

Results: At age 6 months, we found that the percent area of 6E10+ deposits and plaque-associated microglia in Inpp5d knockdown mice were increased compared to controls. Spatial transcriptomics identified a plaque-specific expression profile that was extensively altered by Inpp5d knockdown.

Discussion: These results demonstrate that conditional Inpp5d downregulation in the PSAPP mouse increases plaque burden and recruitment of microglia to plaques. Spatial transcriptomics highlighted an extended gene expression signature associated with plaques and identified CST7 (cystatin F) as a novel marker of plaques.

Highlights: Inpp5d knockdown increases plaque burden and plaque-associated microglia number. Spatial transcriptomics identifies an expanded plaque-specific gene expression profile.

Methods: We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from multiple human cancers and a mouse tumor transplant model to discover the pleiotropic expression of the Interleukin 7 (IL-7) receptor on T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells.

Results: Our experiment on the mouse model demonstrated that recombinant IL-7 therapy induces tumor regression, expansion of effector CD8 T cells, and pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages.

On the contrary, mesenchymal (m)SMCCs undergo TGFβ paracrine activation of NOX4-p15 effectors. SMCCs display opposing effects also in the immune regulation of neighboring cells, establishing an immunosuppressive environment or leading to an active immune workflow. Both SMCC signatures are predictive biomarkers whose unbalanced ratio determined the clinical outcome in CRLM and CRC patients.

Senescent cancer cells accumulate in CRC favoring tumor dissemination. Whether this mechanism progresses also in metastasis is unexplored. Here, we integrated spatial transcriptomics, 3D-microscopy, and multicellular transcriptomics to study the role of cellular senescence in human colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). We discovered two distinct senescent metastatic cancer cell (SMCC) subtypes, transcriptionally located at the opposite pole of epithelial (e) to mesenchymal (m) transition. SMCCs differ in chemotherapy susceptibility, biological program, and prognostic roles.

However, the therapeutic mechanisms of stem cells remain unclear. Here, we used spatial transcriptomics to elucidate therapeutic mechanisms of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) in an animal model of AD.

Methods: hNSCs were transplanted into the fimbria fornix of the hippocampus using the 5XFAD mouse model. Spatial memory was assessed by Morris water maze. Amyloid plaque burden was quantified. Spatial transcriptomics was performed and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified both globally and within the hippocampus. Subsequent pathway enrichment and ligand-receptor network analysis was performed.

Results: hNSC transplantation restored learning curves of 5XFAD mice. However, there were no changes in amyloid plaque burden. Spatial transcriptomics showed 1,061 DEGs normalized in hippocampal subregions. Plaque induced genes in microglia, along with populations of stage 1 and stage 2 disease associated microglia (DAM), were normalized upon hNSC transplantation. Pathologic signaling between hippocampus and DAM was also restored.

GSE209583_GSM6380093,mouse,brain,38155736,Human neural stem cells restore spatial memory in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model by an immunomodulating mechanism,"Introduction: Stem cells are a promising therapeutic in Alzheimer's disease (AD) given the complex pathophysiologic pathways involved. However, the therapeutic mechanisms of stem cells remain unclear. Here, we used spatial transcriptomics to elucidate therapeutic mechanisms of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) in an animal model of AD.

Methods: hNSCs were transplanted into the fimbria fornix of the hippocampus using the 5XFAD mouse model. Spatial memory was assessed by Morris water maze. Amyloid plaque burden was quantified. Spatial transcriptomics was performed and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified both globally and within the hippocampus. Subsequent pathway enrichment and ligand-receptor network analysis was performed.

Results: hNSC transplantation restored learning curves of 5XFAD mice. However, there were no changes in amyloid plaque burden. Spatial transcriptomics showed 1,061 DEGs normalized in hippocampal subregions. Plaque induced genes in microglia, along with populations of stage 1 and stage 2 disease associated microglia (DAM), were normalized upon hNSC transplantation. Pathologic signaling between hippocampus and DAM was also restored.

Discussion: hNSCs normalized many dysregulated genes, although this was not mediated by a change in amyloid plaque levels. Rather, hNSCs appear to exert beneficial effects in part by modulating microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and signaling in AD.",Alzheimer’s disease; cell communication; disease-associated microglia; immunomodulation; microglia; neural stem cell; spatial transcriptomics; stem cell therapy.,False,Visium,2287,32285

Limited targeted therapeutic options exist for patients with TNBC. Here, we employ spatial transcriptomics to interrogate tissue from a racially diverse TNBC cohort to comprehensively annotate the transcriptional states of spatially resolved cellular populations. A total of 38,706 spatial features from a cohort of 28 sections from 14 patients were analyzed. Intratumoral analysis of spatial features from individual sections revealed heterogeneous transcriptional substructures. However, integrated analysis of all samples resulted in nine transcriptionally distinct clusters that mapped across all individual sections. Furthermore, novel use of join count analysis demonstrated nonrandom directional spatial dependencies of the transcriptionally defined shared clusters, supporting a conserved spatio-transcriptional architecture in TNBC. These findings were substantiated in an independent validation cohort comprising 17,861 spatial features representing 15 samples from 8 patients. Stratification of samples by race revealed race-associated differences in hypoxic tumor content and regions of immune-rich infiltrate. Overall, this study combined spatial and functional molecular analyses to define the tumor architecture of TNBC, with potential implications in understanding TNBC disparities.

Here, we employ spatial transcriptomics to interrogate tissue from a racially diverse TNBC cohort to comprehensively annotate the transcriptional states of spatially resolved cellular populations. A total of 38,706 spatial features from a cohort of 28 sections from 14 patients were analyzed. Intratumoral analysis of spatial features from individual sections revealed heterogeneous transcriptional substructures. However, integrated analysis of all samples resulted in nine transcriptionally distinct clusters that mapped across all individual sections. Furthermore, novel use of join count analysis demonstrated nonrandom directional spatial dependencies of the transcriptionally defined shared clusters, supporting a conserved spatio-transcriptional architecture in TNBC. These findings were substantiated in an independent validation cohort comprising 17,861 spatial features representing 15 samples from 8 patients. Stratification of samples by race revealed race-associated differences in hypoxic tumor content and regions of immune-rich infiltrate. Overall, this study combined spatial and functional molecular analyses to define the tumor architecture of TNBC, with potential implications in understanding TNBC disparities.

These findings were substantiated in an independent validation cohort comprising 17,861 spatial features representing 15 samples from 8 patients. Stratification of samples by race revealed race-associated differences in hypoxic tumor content and regions of immune-rich infiltrate. Overall, this study combined spatial and functional molecular analyses to define the tumor architecture of TNBC, with potential implications in understanding TNBC disparities.

Limited targeted therapeutic options exist for patients with TNBC. Here, we employ spatial transcriptomics to interrogate tissue from a racially diverse TNBC cohort to comprehensively annotate the transcriptional states of spatially resolved cellular populations. A total of 38,706 spatial features from a cohort of 28 sections from 14 patients were analyzed. Intratumoral analysis of spatial features from individual sections revealed heterogeneous transcriptional substructures.

Insights into the mechanisms by which the stroma manipulates the immune microenvironment could help improve cancer treatment. Here, we aimed to elucidate potential approaches for stromal reprogramming and improved cancer immunotherapy. Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGFC) and D expression were significantly associated with a poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer, and PDGF receptor beta (PDGFRβ) was predominantly expressed in diffuse-type gastric cancer stroma. CAFs stimulated with PDGFs exhibited markedly increased expression of CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, and CXCL8, which are involved in polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cell (PMN-MDSC) recruitment. Fibrotic gastric cancer xenograft tumors exhibited increased PMN-MDSC accumulation and decreased lymphocyte infiltration, as well as resistance to anti-PD-1. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics revealed that PDGFRα/β blockade reversed the immunosuppressive microenvironment through stromal modification. Finally, combining PDGFRα/β blockade and anti-PD-1 treatment synergistically suppressed the growth of fibrotic tumors. These findings highlight the impact of stromal reprogramming on immune reactivation and the potential for combined immunotherapy for patients with fibrotic cancer.

We applied spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA-sequencing on patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to profile spatially resolved cell populations within oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+ ) breast cancer and to elucidate their importance in oestrogen-dependent tumour growth.

Methods: Two PDXs of 'ER-high' breast cancers with opposite oestrogen-mediated growth responses were investigated: oestrogen-suppressed GS3 (80-100% ER) and oestrogen-dependent SC31 (40-90% ER) models. The observation was validated via single-cell analyses on an 'ER-low' PDX, GS1 (5% ER). The results from our spatial and single-cell analyses were further supported by a public ER+ breast cancer single-cell dataset and protein-based dual immunohistochemistry (IHC) of SC31 examining important luminal cancer markers (i.e., ER, progesterone receptor and Ki67). The translational implication of our findings was assessed by clinical outcome analyses on publicly available cohorts.

Results: Our space-gene-function study revealed four spatially distinct compartments within ER+ breast cancers. These compartments showed functional diversity (oestrogen-responsive, proliferative, hypoxia-induced and inflammation-related). The 'proliferative' population, rather than the 'oestrogen-responsive' compartment, was crucial for oestrogen-dependent tumour growth, leading to the acquisition of luminal B-like features. The cells expressing typical oestrogen-responsive genes like PGR were not directly linked to oestrogen-dependent proliferation. Dual IHC analyses demonstrated the distinct contribution of the Ki67+ proliferative cells toward oestrogen-mediated growth and their response to a CDK4/6 inhibitor. The gene signatures derived from the proliferative, hypoxia-induced and inflammation-related compartments were significantly correlated with worse clinical outcomes, while patients with the oestrogen-responsive signature showed better prognoses, suggesting that this compartment would not be directly associated with oestrogen-dependent tumour progression.

Conclusions: Our study identified the gene signature in our 'proliferative' compartment as an important determinant of luminal cancer subtypes. This 'proliferative' cell population is a causative feature of luminal B breast cancer, contributing toward its aggressive behaviours.",breast cancer; intratumour heterogeneity; oestrogen receptor; single-cell RNA-sequencing; spatial transcriptomics.,True,Visium,2330,68886

Methods: Two PDXs of 'ER-high' breast cancers with opposite oestrogen-mediated growth responses were investigated: oestrogen-suppressed GS3 (80-100% ER) and oestrogen-dependent SC31 (40-90% ER) models. The observation was validated via single-cell analyses on an 'ER-low' PDX, GS1 (5% ER). The results from our spatial and single-cell analyses were further supported by a public ER+ breast cancer single-cell dataset and protein-based dual immunohistochemistry (IHC) of SC31 examining important luminal cancer markers (i.e., ER, progesterone receptor and Ki67). The translational implication of our findings was assessed by clinical outcome analyses on publicly available cohorts.

Results: Our space-gene-function study revealed four spatially distinct compartments within ER+ breast cancers. These compartments showed functional diversity (oestrogen-responsive, proliferative, hypoxia-induced and inflammation-related). The 'proliferative' population, rather than the 'oestrogen-responsive' compartment, was crucial for oestrogen-dependent tumour growth, leading to the acquisition of luminal B-like features. The cells expressing typical oestrogen-responsive genes like PGR were not directly linked to oestrogen-dependent proliferation. Dual IHC analyses demonstrated the distinct contribution of the Ki67+ proliferative cells toward oestrogen-mediated growth and their response to a CDK4/6 inhibitor. The gene signatures derived from the proliferative, hypoxia-induced and inflammation-related compartments were significantly correlated with worse clinical outcomes, while patients with the oestrogen-responsive signature showed better prognoses, suggesting that this compartment would not be directly associated with oestrogen-dependent tumour progression.

Conclusions: Our study identified the gene signature in our 'proliferative' compartment as an important determinant of luminal cancer subtypes. This 'proliferative' cell population is a causative feature of luminal B breast cancer, contributing toward its aggressive behaviours.",breast cancer; intratumour heterogeneity; oestrogen receptor; single-cell RNA-sequencing; spatial transcriptomics.,True,Visium,1967,68886

Uncaria treatments increase sleep time and quality in humans, and RHY induces sleep in rats. However, like many traditional natural treatments, the mechanisms of action of RHY and Uncaria remain evasive. Moreover, it is unknown whether RHY modifies key brain oscillations during sleep. We thus aimed at defining the effects of RHY on sleep architecture and oscillations throughout a 24-h cycle, as well as identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms. Mice received systemic RHY injections at two times of the day (beginning and end of the light period), and vigilance states were studied by electrocorticographic recordings.

Results: RHY enhanced slow wave sleep (SWS) after both injections, suppressed paradoxical sleep (PS) in the light but enhanced PS in the dark period. Furthermore, RHY modified brain oscillations during both wakefulness and SWS (including delta activity dynamics) in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, most effects were larger in females. A brain spatial transcriptomic analysis showed that RHY modifies the expression of genes linked to cell movement, apoptosis/necrosis, and transcription/translation in a brain region-independent manner, and changes those linked to sleep regulation (e.g., Hcrt, Pmch) in a brain region-specific manner (e.g., in the hypothalamus).

A brain spatial transcriptomic analysis showed that RHY modifies the expression of genes linked to cell movement, apoptosis/necrosis, and transcription/translation in a brain region-independent manner, and changes those linked to sleep regulation (e.g., Hcrt, Pmch) in a brain region-specific manner (e.g., in the hypothalamus).

Conclusions: The findings provide support to the sleep-inducing effect of RHY, expose the relevance to shape wake/sleep oscillations, and highlight its effects on the transcriptome with a high spatial resolution. The exposed molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of a natural compound should benefit sleep- and brain-related medicine.",Electrocorticographic oscillations; Hypothalamus; Molecular profiling; Sex; Sleep induction; Slow wave sleep.,False,Visium,2752,32285

Pigs with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH pigs) develop complex coronary atheromas that are almost identical to human lesions. We reported previously that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) reduced aortic atherosclerosis and promoted features of stable plaque in a murine model. We administered human recombinant IGF-1 or saline (control) in atherosclerotic FH pigs for 6 months. IGF-1 decreased relative coronary atheroma in vivo (intravascular ultrasound) and reduced lesion cross-sectional area (postmortem histology). IGF-1 increased plaque's fibrous cap thickness, and reduced necrotic core, macrophage content, and cell apoptosis, consistent with promotion of a stable plaque phenotype. IGF-1 reduced circulating triglycerides, markers of systemic oxidative stress, and CXCL12 chemokine levels. We used spatial transcriptomics (ST) to identify global transcriptome changes in advanced plaque compartments and to obtain mechanistic insights into IGF-1 effects. ST analysis showed that IGF-1 suppressed FOS/FOSB factors and gene expression of MMP9 and CXCL14 in plaque macrophages, suggesting possible involvement of these molecules in IGF-1's effect on atherosclerosis.

Loss of AQP4 polarization is associated with many diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), AQP4 loses its normal location and thus reduces the clearance of amyloid-β plaques and tau protein. Clinical and experimental studies showed that moxibustion can improve the learning and memory abilities of AD. To explore whether moxibustion can affect the polarization of AQP4 around the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we used spatial transcriptomics (ST) to analyze the expression and polarization of Aqp4 in wild-type mice, APP/PS1 mice, and APP/PS1 mice intervened by moxibustion. The results showed that moxibustion improved the loss of abnormal polarization of AQP4 in APP/PS1 mice, especially in the hypothalamic BBB. Besides, the other 31 genes with Aqp4 as the core have similar depolarization in APP/PS1 mice, most of which are also membrane proteins. The majority of them have been reversed by moxibustion. At the same time, we employed the cerebrospinal fluid circulation gene set, which was found to be at a higher level in the group of APP/PS1 mice with moxibustion treatment. Finally, to further explore its mechanism, we analyzed the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex enzymes closely related to energy metabolism and found that moxibustion can significantly increase the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes such as Cox6a2 in the hypothalamus, which could provide energy for mRNA transport.

Methods: Human dermal fibroblasts from healthy individuals and patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc were treated with or without transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), with or without celastrol.

We apply direct RNA hybridization-based in situ sequencing (dRNA HybISS, Cartana part of 10xGenomics) to compare male and female healthy mouse kidneys and the male kidney injury and repair timecourse. A pre-selected panel of 200 genes is used to identify cell state dynamics patterns during injury and repair. We develop a new computational pipeline, CellScopes, for the rapid analysis, multi-omic integration and visualization of spatially resolved transcriptomic datasets. The resulting dataset allows us to resolve 13 kidney cell types within distinct kidney niches, dynamic alterations in cell state over the course of injury and repair and cell-cell interactions between leukocytes and kidney parenchyma. At late timepoints after injury, C3+ leukocytes are enriched near pro-inflammatory, failed-repair proximal tubule cells.

The most common subtype of IPMNs harbors a gastric foveolar-type epithelium, and these low-grade mucinous neoplasms are harbingers of IPMNs with high-grade dysplasia and cancer. The molecular underpinning of gastric differentiation in IPMNs is unknown, although identifying drivers of this indolent phenotype might enable opportunities for intercepting progression to high-grade IPMN and cancer. We conducted spatial transcriptomics on a cohort of IPMNs, followed by orthogonal and cross-species validation studies, which established the transcription factor NKX6-2 as a key determinant of gastric cell identity in low-grade IPMNs.

The most common subtype of IPMNs harbors a gastric foveolar-type epithelium, and these low-grade mucinous neoplasms are harbingers of IPMNs with high-grade dysplasia and cancer. The molecular underpinning of gastric differentiation in IPMNs is unknown, although identifying drivers of this indolent phenotype might enable opportunities for intercepting progression to high-grade IPMN and cancer. We conducted spatial transcriptomics on a cohort of IPMNs, followed by orthogonal and cross-species validation studies, which established the transcription factor NKX6-2 as a key determinant of gastric cell identity in low-grade IPMNs. Loss of NKX6-2 expression is a consistent feature of IPMN progression, while reexpression of Nkx6-2 in murine IPMN lines recapitulates the aforementioned gastric transcriptional program and glandular morphology.

We demonstrated that a risk variant for Crohn's disease, hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFAC) Arg509His (R509H), disrupted a damage-sensing pathway connecting the coagulation cascade to growth factors that drive the differentiation of wound-associated epithelial (WAE) cells and production of a localized retinoic acid (RA) gradient to promote fibroblast-mediated tissue remodeling. Specifically, we showed that HGFAC R509H was activated by thrombin protease activity but exhibited impaired proteolytic activation of the growth factor macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP).

GSE240715_GSM7708218,mouse,brain,37855382,Spatial transcriptomics map of the embryonic mouse brain - a tool to explore neurogenesis,"The developing brain has a well-organized anatomical structure comprising different types of neural and non-neural cells. Stem cells, progenitors and newborn neurons tightly interact with their neighbouring cells and tissue microenvironment, and this intricate interplay ultimately shapes the output of neurogenesis. Given the relevance of spatial cues during brain development, we acknowledge the necessity for a spatial transcriptomics map accessible to the neurodevelopmental community. To fulfil this need, we generated spatially resolved RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from embryonic day 13.5 mouse brain sections immunostained for mitotic active neural and vascular cells. Unsupervised clustering defined specific cell type populations of diverse lineages and differentiation states.

GSE243179_GSM7780296,human,heart,37881937,Clonal Proliferation Within Smooth Muscle Cells in Unstable Human Atherosclerotic Lesions,"Background: Studies in humans and mice using the expression of an X-linked gene or lineage tracing, respectively, have suggested that clones of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) exist in human atherosclerotic lesions but are limited by either spatial resolution or translatability of the model.

Methods: Phenotypic clonality can be detected by X-chromosome inactivation patterns. We investigated whether clones of SMCs exist in unstable human atheroma using RNA in situ hybridization (BaseScope) to identify a naturally occurring 24-nucleotide deletion in the 3'UTR of the X-linked BGN (biglycan) gene, a proteoglycan highly expressed by SMCs. BGN-specific BaseScope probes were designed to target the wild-type or deletion mRNA. Three different coronary artery plaque types (erosion, rupture, and adaptive intimal thickening) were selected from heterozygous females for the deletion BGN. Hybridization of target RNA-specific probes was used to visualize the spatial distribution of mutants. A clonality index was calculated from the percentage of each probe in each region of interest. Spatial transcriptomics were used to identify differentially expressed transcripts within clonal and nonclonal regions.

Results: Less than one-half of regions of interest in the intimal plaque were considered clonal with the mean percent regions of interest with clonality higher in the intimal plaque than in the media. This was consistent for all plaque types. The relationship of the dominant clone in the intimal plaque and media showed significant concordance. In comparison with the nonclonal lesions, the regions with SMC clonality had lower expression of genes encoding cell growth suppressors such as CD74, SERF-2 (small EDRK-rich factor 2), CTSB (cathepsin B), and HLA-DPA1 (major histocompatibility complex, class II, DP alpha 1), among others.

Conclusions: Our novel approach to examine clonality suggests atherosclerosis is primarily a disease of polyclonally and to a lesser extent clonally expanded SMCs and may have implications for the development of antiatherosclerotic therapies.",atherosclerosis; biglycan; coronary artery disease; gene expression; pathology.,False,Visium,2615,17943

Paradoxically, the presence of AER in the axolotl, a primary model organism for regeneration, remains controversial. Here, by leveraging a single-cell transcriptomics-based multi-species atlas, composed of axolotl, human, mouse, chicken, and frog cells, we first establish that axolotls contain cells with AER characteristics. Further analyses and spatial transcriptomics reveal that axolotl limbs do not fully re-form AER cells during regeneration. Moreover, the axolotl mesoderm displays part of the AER machinery, revealing a program for limb (re)growth. These results clarify the debate about the axolotl AER and the extent to which the limb developmental program is recapitulated during regeneration.",,False,Visium,1089,99088

The form with symptomatic muscular involvement is called muscular sarcoidosis. The impact of immune cells composing the granuloma on the skeletal muscle is misunderstood. Here, we investigated the granuloma-skeletal muscle interactions through spatial transcriptomics on two patients affected by muscular sarcoidosis. Five major transcriptomic clusters corresponding to perigranuloma, granuloma, and three successive muscle tissue areas (proximal, intermediate, and distal) around the granuloma were identified. Analyses revealed upregulated pathways in the granuloma corresponding to the activation of T-lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages cytokines, the upregulation of extracellular matrix signatures, and the induction of the TGF-β signaling in the perigranuloma. A comparison between the proximal and distal muscles to the granuloma revealed an inverse correlation between the distance to the granuloma and the upregulation of cellular response to interferon-γ/α, TNF-α, IL-1,4,6, fibroblast proliferation, epithelial to mesenchymal cell transition, and the downregulation of muscle gene expression. These data shed light on the intercommunications between granulomas and the muscle tissue and provide pathophysiological mechanisms by showing that granuloma immune cells have a direct impact on proximal muscle tissue by promoting its progressive replacement by fibrosis via the expression of pro-inflammatory and profibrosing signatures.

In this study, we aimed to explore whether transcriptionally active HBV integration events spread throughout the liver tissue in different phases of chronic HBV infection, especially in patients with HBsAg loss.

Design: We constructed high-resolution spatial transcriptomes of liver biopsies containing 13 059 tissue spots from 18 patients with chronic HBV infection to analyse the occurrence and relative distribution of transcriptionally active viral integration events. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression of HBsAg and HBV core antigen. Intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) levels were quantified by real-time qPCR.

Results: Spatial transcriptome sequencing identified the presence of 13 154 virus-host chimeric reads in 7.86% (1026 of 13 059) of liver tissue spots in all patients, including three patients with HBsAg loss. These HBV integration sites were randomly distributed on chromosomes and can localise in host genes involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, such as ALB, CLU and APOB. Patients who were receiving or had received antiviral treatment had a significantly lower percentage of viral integration-containing spots and significantly fewer chimeric reads than treatment-naïve patients. Intrahepatic cccDNA levels correlated well with viral integration events.

Conclusion: Transcriptionally active HBV integration occurred in chronically HBV-infected patients at different phases, including in patients with HBsAg loss.

These HBV integration sites were randomly distributed on chromosomes and can localise in host genes involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, such as ALB, CLU and APOB. Patients who were receiving or had received antiviral treatment had a significantly lower percentage of viral integration-containing spots and significantly fewer chimeric reads than treatment-naïve patients. Intrahepatic cccDNA levels correlated well with viral integration events.

Conclusion: Transcriptionally active HBV integration occurred in chronically HBV-infected patients at different phases, including in patients with HBsAg loss. Antiviral treatment was associated with a decreased number and extent of transcriptionally active viral integrations, implying that early treatment intervention may further reduce the number of viral integration events.",chronic viral hepatitis; hepatitis B; liver biopsy.,False,Visium,1574,36601

Macrophages (Mϕ) hold promise as prognostic classifiers and therapeutic targets. Here, stemming from a single-cell analysis of mononuclear phagocytes infiltrating human CLM, we identified two Mϕ markers associated with distinct populations with opposite clinical relevance. The invasive margin of CLM was enriched in pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived Mϕ (MoMϕ) expressing the monocytic marker SERPINB2, and a more differentiated population, tumor-associated Mϕ (TAM), expressing glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB). SERPINB2+ MoMϕ had an early inflammatory profile, whereas GPNMB+ TAMs were enriched in pathways of matrix degradation, angiogenesis, and lipid metabolism and were found closer to the tumor margin, as confirmed by spatial transcriptomics on CLM specimens. In a cohort of patients, a high infiltration of SERPINB2+ cells independently associated with longer disease-free survival (DFS; P = 0.033), whereas a high density of GPNMB+ cells correlated with shorter DFS (P = 0.012) and overall survival (P = 0.002). Cell-cell interaction analysis defined opposing roles for MoMϕ and TAMs, suggesting that SERPINB2+ and GPNMB+ cells are discrete populations of Mϕ and may be exploited for further translation to an immune-based stratification tool. This study provides evidence of how multi-omics approaches can identify nonredundant, clinically relevant markers for further translation to immune-based patient stratification tools and therapeutic targets. GPNMB has been shown to set Mϕ in an immunosuppressive mode.

Although advances have been made in acute treatment, an incomplete understanding of remodelling processes has limited the effectiveness of therapies to reduce late-stage mortality2. Here we generate an integrative high-resolution map of human cardiac remodelling after myocardial infarction using single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility and spatial transcriptomic profiling of multiple physiological zones at distinct time points in myocardium from patients with myocardial infarction and controls. Multi-modal data integration enabled us to evaluate cardiac cell-type compositions at increased resolution, yielding insights into changes of the cardiac transcriptome and epigenome through the identification of distinct tissue structures of injury, repair and remodelling.

Multi-modal data integration enabled us to evaluate cardiac cell-type compositions at increased resolution, yielding insights into changes of the cardiac transcriptome and epigenome through the identification of distinct tissue structures of injury, repair and remodelling. We identified and validated disease-specific cardiac cell states of major cell types and analysed them in their spatial context, evaluating their dependency on other cell types. Our data elucidate the molecular principles of human myocardial tissue organization, recapitulating a gradual cardiomyocyte and myeloid continuum following ischaemic injury. In sum, our study provides an integrative molecular map of human myocardial infarction, represents an essential reference for the field and paves the way for advanced mechanistic and therapeutic studies of cardiac disease.",,False,Visium,2029,36601
